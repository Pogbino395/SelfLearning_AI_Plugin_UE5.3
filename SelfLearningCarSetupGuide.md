## **Self-Learning Car Example**
Watch this example to see the progression of a self-learning car in Unreal Engine 5.3. This demonstration includes two short videos showcasing the car's development through different generations of training.

### **1st Generation**
In this video, observe the initial attempts of the AI-driven car as it begins learning how to navigate the environment. The car's movements are basic and somewhat erratic as it starts to understand the dynamics of the virtual world.

### **4th Generation**
This video highlights the significant improvements in the car's navigation skills by the fourth generation of training. Notice how the car moves more smoothly and efficiently, having learned from its previous iterations.
